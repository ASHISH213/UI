<h2>HTML concepts</h2>

<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web.
     It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides
      HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) 
      or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
</p>

<p>
    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website
     or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
      and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

<h2>CSS Concept</h2>

<p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used 
    to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML 
    or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
     CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper,
      in speech, or on other media.
